# Building the Backend

Here are some simple instructions on how to build the backend to be run locally. 

1. Ensure that you have NPM and NodeJS installed.
2. Once that is complete, run ```npm install```. This should install all required dependencies from package.json.
3. In the file ```package.json```, modify or add the following line under scripts: ```"start": "nodemon index.js"```
4. You should be able to run ```npm start``` and should be good to go from here.
