### Problem Definition: outline the problem requirements and include the application domain and motivations of your project. 
>  1. Problem Description
>     - Develop a web application for a personal budget tracker that tracks and organises income, expenses, and overall spending. The software prioritises user-friendliness, customizability, and privacy. 
>  2. Requirements Elicitation
>     - 2.1 User Roles
>         - Parent
>         - Child
>     - 2.2 Functionality for Parent
>         - Input income streams.
>         - Input expected expenses.
>         - Add accounts (eg. Chequing, savings, credit cards, loans, retirement savings).
>         - Create savings/debt reduction goals.
>         - Synch with partners accounts and share common expenses.
>         - Track and compare actual spending to spending goals, and highlight differences.
>         - Oversee financial information of entire family.
>     - 2.3 Functionality for Child
>         - Input income streams.
>         - Input expenses.
>         - Add savings goals.
>     - 2.4 Qualities Requirements
>         - **User-Friendliness:**  displays information in an aestetically pleasing manner, highlighting important information, easy and intuitive navigation through the application and its functions.
>         - **Customizability:**  provide a well-rounded template for the user to tailor the system to their needs.
>         - **Correctness:**  application should display current figures with accuracy.
>         - **Privacy:**  although banking information is not exchanged with the application, a secure login procedure protects the privacy of the user.
>  4. Application Domain
>     - The application domain of our project is personal finance management. Our software aids in effectively managing personal finances by tracking income, expeneses, savings, investmenets, and other transactions. It is specifically desgined for managing finances of individuals and immediate families. 
>  5. Motivations
>     - The inspiration for this application comes from the lack of accessible and easy-to-use online budget tracking and planning services. Traditional banking apps can be hard to use and extract meaningful information from. Competing online budget planners and trackers come with a price tag and are missing key functionalities.

### Application Benefits: what are the benefits of your application when compared to existing systems. Choose two systems only and include their reference. 
> According to Rachel Murphy and Courtney Reilly-Larke in Forbes Advisor's [Best Budgeting Apps for Febrary 2024](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/ca/banking/best-budgeting-apps/), YNAB (You Need a Budget) holds the title of best budgeting app for achieving financial goals, and PocketGuard is named best budgeting app for tracking spending. These applications were selected to best compare our software to based on the basic functions and principles we have built our application around.\
> \
> Firstly, [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) is best recognized for “focusing on your present situation and future possibilities” to help consumers meet their financial goals. Some of the main pros to this application are accessibility from several different devices, shareability (with one other person), and live assistance from staff. Whereas the cons outlined in the Forbes Advisor column state that the user interface isn’t much different from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and there is a lack of investment tracking. YNAB offers a 34 day, risk-free trial followed by a subscription at $20 CAD a month or $132.20 CAD a year.\
> \
> In contrast, our budget tracker and planner website offers free services that meet the same needs YNAB fills and more. Our unique approach prioritises families financial needs by not only allowing a shared account with one other person, but with the whole family. Our website is so user-friendly that even children are able to use it and gain experience with planning budgets and tracking finances. Unlike YNAB, we offer the ability to input and track your investments. Although there can be benefits in only looking at the present and future of your finances, we believe that there is valuable information that lies within previous spending habits that can be useful when making financial goals. That is why our budget tracker and planner utilises your past spending habits to analyse and point out trends that can help steer you in the right direction when it comes to paying off debt, acquiring savings, etc.\
> \
> The next existing application we’ve chosen to compare is [PocketGuard](https://pocketguard.com/), which is said to be most effective to track your spending. With easy to read diagrams like pie charts and drop down menus, it establishes an effective way to visualise overspending. Another major pro of this application is the ability to link and integrate online bank accounts from thousands of different institutions. In addition, PocketGuard makes it easy to build custom budgets and set goals for savings. Some downsides of this application are the limited features to free users and it is said to be quite challenging to navigate. Along with the free version, they also offer a “Plus” version that costs the user $10.67 CAD monthly, $46.72 yearly, or $106.81 CAD for lifetime.\
> \
> Unlike PocketGuard, our application is intuitive and easy to navigate. So much so that even children are able to use it with ease. Our application also integrates the use of diagrams that are pleasing to the eye and make it easy to visualise spending patterns. Additionally, we offer full use of all our features to customers for free. Although PocketGuard is substantially more affordable than YNAB, we believe that an application that delivers budgeting and financial tracking capabilities should not add more stress to your bank account.\
