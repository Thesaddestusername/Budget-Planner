# Building the Frontend

Here are some simple instructions on how to build the frontend to be run locally. 

1. Change directories into frontend/budget-buddy
2. Ensure that you have NPM and NodeJS installed.
3. Once that is complete, run ```npm install```. This should install all required dependencies from package.json.
4. You should be able to run ```npm start``` and should be good to go from here.
